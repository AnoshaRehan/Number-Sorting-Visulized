## Number-Sorting-Visulized
# Intoduction  
This project demonstrates an overview of various sorting algorithms accompanied with colourful GUI and visualization.  
This project gives the user a choice between different sorting algorithms with their visualization as non-static bars representing different numbers from the input file and their current state i.e. sorting, waiting_for_sort and Done.  

# The Algorithms  
* Bubble Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Count Sort

# Experimental Setup  
The array size is 500, so for every sort, the array size is constant and therefore some sorts may perform better than actual time complexities because of the machine and data size.  

There are three text files of input that have been generated via the code:  
* Completely sorted
* Reverse sorted
* Random numbers

# Conclusion  
Quick Sort modified with Insertion Sort is shown to be allegedly faster.
While merge sort is a better sort but we suppose that this depends on the machine and data input size.
